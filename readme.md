# nbviewerviewer

A Google Chrome extension to view IPython notebooks from GitHub. When browsed a
IPython notebook file (the ones with `.ipynb` extension), this extension
redirects you to [nbviewer.ipython.org] to view the notebook properly, rather
than raw format what GitHub does.

## Example

When you are browsing a project in GitHub,

instead of the raw IPython notebook file

you would see this
